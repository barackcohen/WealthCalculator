# WealthCalculator
This program will calculate the value of your investments account, given your starting point, monthly investment, expected yearly yield and time till retirement.

You will be asked if you would like to see the growth. If you type 'y', you'll see the value of your account after every five years.
You will also be shown your overall profit, expected taxes (25% on profit), overall yield and the amount you'll have after taxes.

This program requires Java to run.

To run, use your favorite IDE or type 'java WealthCalculator.java' in your terminal/cmd.
